# Phase 1: Logic and Foundations



Completed Monday Front-Load: Logic, Algos, C++, and SE

Documented Software Engineering complexity and the SDLC. Pushed C++ Hello World and Discrete Logic notes.



Paused Algorithmic Toolbox after Week 1 completion. Shifting to a 2-a-day Discrete Mathematics schedule to build the foundational logic required for advanced algorithm analysis.

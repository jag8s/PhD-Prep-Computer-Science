Proofs?
A proof is an argument so convincing that you are ready to use it to convince other people
This by-product is a sign of understanding

Proofs from THE BOOK by Paul Erdos


The puzzle was interesting. I knew and understood that 1x2 domino can cover a 8x8 board because each domino covered 2 squares, the tiles had to be even. I knew instinctively that certain configurations wouldn't work, but didn't understand why. Now I understand that for this puzzle not only does the board have to be even but the number of tile "Types", in this case black and white, had to be even. So a board with top left and bottom right corners missing is impossible because there where 30 white tiles and 32 black tiles, each domino requires exactly 1 black tile and 1 white tile.

The Invariant of the Mutilated Chessboard
Problem: Can a $1 \times 2$ domino tile an $8 \times 8$ board with two opposite corners removed?
Logic: An $8 \times 8$ board has 32 black and 32 white squares. Removing opposite corners removes two squares of the same color (e.g., 2 black).
Proof: Since each domino requires $1B$ and $1W$, and we now have 30 Black and 32 White, a perfect tiling is mathematically impossible.

# Phase 1: Logic and Foundations Discrete Mathemeatics



1/26/2026: Logic \& Environment Setup



Discrete Math: Mastered the fundamentals of "Existence Proofs." Completed the Tile a Chessboard puzzle (Score: 100%).



Environment: Successfully configured the local Python development environment using PyCharm.



Key Insight: Realized how a seemingly complex tiling problem can be reduced to a parity (even/odd) logic check.

Subject\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Progress\*\*Velocity\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Status\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Week 2 Goal

Discrete Math,       34%       On Pace (Finish Week 3) Maintain steady 34% effort.

C++ Fundamentals,    24%       Trailing (-10%)         Sprint Priority: Aim for 60% total.

Software Engineering 24%       Ahead (Backing off)     Maintenance:     3 sessions/week.



Strategic Adjustments

The C++ Sprint: To hit the 7-week goal for both Fundamentals and Intermediate, C++ is moving to a "2-a-day" schedule on SE off-days, plus a dedicated Saturday session.



The Algorithms Domino: Algorithms remains delayed until Week 3 to allow Discrete Math to finish. Once Discrete is clear, that study capacity will be reallocated to Algorithms and C++ Intermediate.



Week 1 Knowledge Recap

Discrete: Mastered the Existence vs. Optimality framework. Successfully solved extremal problems for subsets (forbidden pairs) and chessboard configurations (Rooks/Knights/Bishops).



C++ Foundations: 100% on Module 1 Comp. Eval. Mastered the Compilation Pipeline (Preprocessing -> Compilation -> Linking) and enforced professional naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, SCREAMING\_SNAKE\_CASE).



Software Engineering: Defined the Association Class (handling data belonging to a relationship) and Generalization (implementing "Is-A" inheritance structures).
